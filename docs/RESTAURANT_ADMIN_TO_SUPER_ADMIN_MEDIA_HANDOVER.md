# Handover: Restaurant Admin Media (Cloudinary) → Super Admin Console

> **Audience:** AI / developer updating the **ForkFleet Super Admin console**
> (`forkfleet-admin-console`, this repo) so each restaurant gets its own Media (Cloudinary)
> configuration tab, matching Restaurant Admin ("Orderly Hub").
> **Direction:** same direction as `RESTAURANT_ADMIN_TO_SUPER_ADMIN_PAYMENTS_HANDOVER.md` — Orderly
> Hub is the **source of truth**, Super Admin is the one being brought up to date.
> **Source of truth:** Restaurant Admin (`orderlyhub-main`), `src/pages/Settings.tsx`,
> `src/lib/cloudinary.ts`, `src/lib/restaurants.firebase.ts` — snapshot as of **2026-09-20**.
> **Scope:** give each restaurant its own Cloudinary cloud name + unsigned upload preset (its own
> "account" for pictures/assets), so Super Admin and Restaurant Admin read/write the *same*
> per-restaurant fields and stay linked to that one restaurant — **decided:** not a shared,
> platform-wide Cloudinary account (see §1.2 — this used to be an open decision in an earlier draft
> of this doc; it is now settled).

Related docs: `RESTAURANT_ADMIN_TO_SUPER_ADMIN_PAYMENTS_HANDOVER.md` documents the sibling
`payment_config` field on the same restaurant record and the shape/landmine conventions this doc
follows (exact-shape schema blocks, "decide deliberately" landmines, flag-don't-redesign security
notes). Read that one first if any convention here is unclear — this doc doesn't repeat those
ground rules, only the Media-specific content. `RESTAURANT_ADMIN_TO_SUPER_ADMIN_CUSTOMERS_HANDOVER.md`
covers an unrelated data-freshness gap (Super Admin's Customers view using demo data instead of live
per-restaurant records) — it shares no schema with this doc, it's cross-referenced only because both
were raised in the same handover pass.

---

## 0. Two corrections to make before you start

**0.1 — Orderly Hub's own `docs/CLOUDINARY_MEDIA_HANDOVER.md` is partially stale.** It describes a
`businessId` / `settings/business` / `settings/businesses/{id}` path scheme via
`src/lib/businessSettingsPath.ts`. That file exists but is **dead code** — `getBusinessSettingsPath`
is defined there and never imported anywhere else in `src/`. Do not copy that scheme. The actual,
live path is the flat one in §1.1 below.

**0.2 — This app is Firebase Realtime Database, not Firestore**, despite the companion Payments
handover doc calling it "Cloud Firestore". There are zero matches for `firestore` anywhere in
Orderly Hub's `src/` — it's `firebase/database` (`getDatabase(app)`), and every path below is an
RTDB node path (slash-delimited), not a Firestore document path. This naming inconsistency already
exists across both docs and both apps' own code comments (this repo's `payments.firebase.ts` says
"Realtime Database" in one comment and is read/written through an `fs*`-prefixed helper module
elsewhere) — worth knowing so you don't go looking for a Firestore SDK call that isn't there, but
not something to "fix" by renaming things; match whichever term the file you're editing already
uses.

---

## 1. What you must understand first

### 1.1 Two flat fields on the restaurant's own record — not nested, not a separate document

```
restaurants/{restaurantId}                          -> the restaurant record (name, phone, hours,
                                                        image_url, payment_config, ...)
restaurants/{restaurantId}.cloudinaryCloudName       -> string
restaurants/{restaurantId}.cloudinaryUploadPreset    -> string
```

Path helper, `src/lib/restaurant-scope.ts`:

```ts
export function restaurantPath(restaurantId: string): string {
  return `restaurants/${restaurantId}`;
}
```

These two fields are **siblings of `payment_config`** on the exact same record (see the Payments
handover doc §1.1) — not a nested `media` or `branding` object, and not a separate document. The
type declaration confirms it, `src/lib/restaurants.firebase.ts` (`FirebaseRestaurant` interface):

```ts
cloudinaryCloudName?: string;
cloudinaryUploadPreset?: string;
```

sitting alongside `name`, `phone`, `opens_at`, `closes_at`, `prep_time_minutes`, `image_url`, etc.
Because these fields live directly on `restaurants/{restaurantId}`, reading or writing them **is
inherently scoped to that one restaurant** — there is no separate keying step needed to "link" the
Media tab to a restaurant, the same way there is none for the Payments tab. A Super Admin "Media"
tab that reads/writes `restaurants/{id}.cloudinaryCloudName` for whichever `{id}` the operator is
currently viewing is, by construction, that restaurant's own Media config and no other restaurant's.

### 1.2 Decided: each restaurant gets its own separate Cloudinary *account* — one Media tab per restaurant, no folder namespacing

This is the important architectural point behind "linked to each restaurant" in the ask that
produced this doc, and it is now a **settled decision**, not an open question: **Super Admin must
give every restaurant its own "Media (Cloudinary)" tab, scoped to that restaurant's own record, the
same way the Payments tab is scoped per restaurant.** There is exactly one Cloudinary cloud
name + one upload preset per restaurant, stored on that restaurant's own document, edited from that
restaurant's own detail page, and consumed only by uploads made in that restaurant's own context
(its menu items, categories, cover image, logo). No restaurant's Media tab reads or writes another
restaurant's fields, and no tab is a shared, cross-restaurant control.

Orderly Hub's upload call (`src/lib/cloudinary.ts`) only ever sends `file` and `upload_preset` in the
form body — **no `folder`, `tags`, `public_id`, or restaurant-id-derived path parameter is ever
passed to Cloudinary.** Isolation between restaurants' image libraries is achieved purely by
*configuration*, not by namespacing inside a shared account: every restaurant is expected to have its
own Cloudinary account (or at least its own cloud) and paste in its own cloud name + its own unsigned
preset into its own Media tab. If two restaurants were misconfigured with the same cloud name, their
uploads would land in the same Cloudinary media library with zero collision-avoidance in this
codebase — which is exactly why each restaurant's Media tab must write to that restaurant's own
fields and nowhere else.

For context, an earlier draft of this doc raised a shared-account-with-folders alternative
(`folder: restaurants/{restaurantId}` in the upload form body, one platform-wide Cloudinary account)
as something to "decide deliberately." **That alternative is not being pursued.** It would scale
account-provisioning better, but it is a behavior change from what Orderly Hub does today and would
require Orderly Hub to adopt folder namespacing too or the two apps would diverge on how isolation
works — out of scope for this handover. Build per-restaurant tabs against per-restaurant fields, per
§1.1, and stop there.

### 1.3 Only two fields exist — no API secret, ever

Confirmed by reading the full `cloudinary.ts` and grepping the whole `src/` tree for "cloudinary":
`cloudinaryCloudName` and `cloudinaryUploadPreset` are the **only** two Cloudinary-related fields
anywhere in Orderly Hub. No API key, no API secret, no folder, no tags field. All uploads are
**unsigned** — this is the one part of the Payments doc's §2.5 security warning that does *not*
apply here: there is no secret to accidentally ship to the browser, because Cloudinary's unsigned
upload flow was designed not to need one client-side.

---

## 2. Exact shape (copy verbatim)

```ts
// restaurants/{restaurantId} — two of many sibling fields, alongside payment_config
interface FirebaseRestaurant {
  // ...existing fields (name, phone, opens_at, closes_at, prep_time_minutes, image_url, ...)
  cloudinaryCloudName?: string;      // "" / undefined when unset — camelCase
  cloudinaryUploadPreset?: string;   // "" / undefined when unset — camelCase, MUST be an
                                      // unsigned preset (Cloudinary dashboard → Upload →
                                      // Upload presets → Signing mode: Unsigned)
}
```

**Preserve the camelCase naming**, same reasoning as `stripePublishableKey`/`stripeSecretKey` in the
Payments doc — these two fields already exist under these exact names in production Orderly Hub
data; renaming them here would just create an unreadable second copy of the same setting.

---

## 3. UI (reference: Orderly Hub `src/pages/Settings.tsx` lines ~185–212)

- Section heading **"Media (Cloudinary)"**, its own card, sitting between "Business Information" and
  "Payment Methods" on Orderly Hub's single flat Settings page.
- Caption above the fields: *"Images for products, categories, and this logo upload go to
  Cloudinary. Create an **unsigned** upload preset in Cloudinary and enter its name below. The API
  secret is not stored here and is not used in the browser."*
- Two fields side by side:
  - **Cloud name** — placeholder `e.g. dnmcti0xs`
  - **Upload preset (unsigned)** — placeholder `e.g. ml_default or my_app_uploads`
- Caption below: *"If these are empty, the app falls back to `VITE_CLOUDINARY_*` in `.env` for local
  development only."*
- The restaurant's **logo** upload control is a *separate* section above this one ("Business
  Information"), not inside the Media card — but it consumes these same two fields once saved.
- Gating: the whole Settings form is disabled from saving when read-only; the two inputs themselves
  are not individually `disabled` — only the Save button is gated (`disabled={saving || readOnly}`).

---

## 4. Upload mechanism (reference: `src/lib/cloudinary.ts`, full file — unsigned only)

```ts
export function resolveCloudinaryOptions(overrides?: CloudinaryUploadOverrides | null) {
  const fromEnvName = (env.VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME ?? "").trim();
  const fromEnvPreset = (env.VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET ?? "").trim() || "ml_default";
  const cloudName = (overrides?.cloudName?.trim() || fromEnvName).trim();
  const uploadPreset = (overrides?.uploadPreset?.trim() || fromEnvPreset).trim() || "ml_default";
  return { cloudName, uploadPreset };
}

export const uploadToCloudinary = async (file: File, overrides?: CloudinaryUploadOverrides | null) => {
  const { cloudName, uploadPreset } = resolveCloudinaryOptions(overrides ?? undefined);
  if (!cloudName) throw new Error("Cloudinary cloud name is missing. ...");
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append("file", file);
  formData.append("upload_preset", uploadPreset);
  const { data } = await axios.post(
    `https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/${cloudName}/image/upload`,
    formData,
    { headers: { "Content-Type": "multipart/form-data" } },
  );
  if (!data?.secure_url) throw new Error("Cloudinary upload succeeded but no secure_url was returned.");
  return data.secure_url;
};
```

- **No Cloudinary SDK, no upload widget** — a raw multipart POST. Only `secure_url` is ever
  persisted; the binary never touches Firebase.
- Optional best-effort audit log at `uploads/images` (global, not per-restaurant): `{ url, createdAt,
  context, userId }`. Logging failures are swallowed (`console.error`), never surfaced to the user.
- This is architecturally **identical** to what this repo (Super Admin) already does for the
  *platform-wide* Cloudinary config — see `src/lib/cloudinary.ts`,
  `src/hooks/use-cloudinary-config.ts`, `src/components/cloudinary-image-upload.tsx`. You are not
  building new upload machinery; you're adding a second, per-restaurant *source* of `cloudName` /
  `uploadPreset` that the existing machinery already accepts via its `overrides` prop.

---

## 5. What Super Admin already has today (starting point)

This repo already has a **platform-wide** Media (Cloudinary) config — one cloud name + one preset
for the whole platform:

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `src/lib/settings.firebase.ts` | `MediaSettings` type + `PlatformSettings.media`, stored at RTDB `settings.media` |
| `src/lib/cloudinary.ts` | `resolveCloudinaryOptions()` / `uploadToCloudinary()` — priority: `overrides` → `VITE_CLOUDINARY_*` → `"ml_default"` |
| `src/hooks/use-cloudinary-config.ts` | Subscribes to `settings.media`, exposes it as `overrides` for `CloudinaryImageUpload` |
| `src/components/cloudinary-image-upload.tsx` | The upload widget — already accepts an `overrides` prop that takes priority over the subscribed platform settings |
| `src/routes/_authenticated/settings.tsx` (tab `media`, ~lines 610–677) | The existing platform-wide "Media (Cloudinary)" UI — this is the pattern to copy per-restaurant, not a second unrelated thing to build |

Every current per-restaurant image upload call site uses this **platform-wide** config today —
there is no restaurant-level override yet, because `FirebaseRestaurant` doesn't have the field:

| # | File | Line | `context` | Uses |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `src/routes/_authenticated/restaurants/index.tsx` | 881 | `"restaurant_cover"` | Create-restaurant dialog cover image |
| 2 | `src/routes/_authenticated/restaurants/$id.tsx` | 614 | `"restaurant_cover"` | Restaurant detail → cover image (Profile tab) |
| 3 | `src/routes/_authenticated/menus.tsx` | 602 | `"product"` | Menu item photo (one dialog) |
| 4 | `src/routes/_authenticated/menus.tsx` | 1143 | `"product"` | Menu item photo (second dialog) |

**Adding the field to `FirebaseRestaurant` alone accomplishes nothing** — you must also update these
four call sites (and the new Media tab's own logo/cover fields, if any) to pass
`overrides={{ cloudName: restaurant.cloudinaryCloudName, uploadPreset: restaurant.cloudinaryUploadPreset }}`,
falling through to the platform-wide config when the restaurant hasn't set its own (see §6).

---

## 6. Config resolution priority — extend the existing chain, don't replace it

Super Admin's `resolveCloudinaryOptions()` already implements: `overrides` (passed in) →
`VITE_CLOUDINARY_*` env → `"ml_default"` preset fallback. Insert a new tier so a restaurant's own
credentials take priority over the platform ones, without breaking any restaurant that hasn't
configured its own yet:

1. **Restaurant's own** `cloudinaryCloudName` / `cloudinaryUploadPreset` (new — this doc) — this is
   the tier that makes the Media tab "linked to" one specific restaurant; every other tier below is a
   shared fallback that applies identically regardless of which restaurant is being viewed.
2. **Platform-wide** `settings.media.cloudinary_cloud_name` / `cloudinary_upload_preset` (existing
   global Settings → Media tab)
3. `VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` / `VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET` env (existing, dev-only)
4. `"ml_default"` preset default (existing)

This mirrors Orderly Hub's own priority chain (its settings → its env fallback); Super Admin just has
one extra tier in the middle because it has a platform-wide concept that a single-tenant app like
Orderly Hub doesn't need. Build this resolution where the call site already knows both the
restaurant record and the platform settings (e.g. compose the two `overrides` objects before
passing them to `CloudinaryImageUpload`, restaurant-level values first) — don't duplicate
`resolveCloudinaryOptions()`'s internal logic a second time.

---

## 7. New "Media" tab on the restaurant detail page — one per restaurant, scoped to that restaurant

Add a tab titled **"Media"** to the existing `TabsList` in
`src/routes/_authenticated/restaurants/$id.tsx` (alongside `Profile & commission | Business hours |
Branches | Delivery fees | Points & Rewards | Payments | Team`), gated on the same
`canManage = staff.hasPermission("restaurants.manage")` already used by every other tab on this
page. Orderly Hub also bundles Cloudinary editing into its general settings/profile permission
(`rm.settings.manage` / `rm.profile.manage`) rather than a dedicated one — see §8 — so this keeps
parity; deviate only if you have a specific reason to.

Because this tab lives on the **restaurant detail page**, it is inherently keyed to whichever
restaurant's `$id` route param is currently open — the same way the existing Payments tab on this
same page is. There is no additional linking step required: reading and saving must simply target
`restaurants/{id}.cloudinaryCloudName` / `restaurants/{id}.cloudinaryUploadPreset` for that route's
`id`, never a global or cross-restaurant path. If you add a restaurant switcher or a bulk-edit view
anywhere in Super Admin, the Media tab must **not** be reachable from it without an explicit
restaurant selected — there is no such thing as an unscoped Media config.

Tab content, adapted from §3:
- Cloud name input + Upload preset (unsigned) input, same captions.
- Unlike Orderly Hub (single-tenant, nothing to distinguish), Super Admin needs an indicator of
  **which tier is actually active** for this restaurant right now — e.g. "Using this restaurant's
  own Cloudinary account" vs "Using the platform default (Settings → Media)" — since §6 introduces a
  fallback chain Orderly Hub doesn't have to reason about.
- Reuse `CloudinaryImageUpload` for any preview/test-upload affordance you add here, the same
  component already used everywhere else in this repo.

---

## 8. Permissions

From Orderly Hub's `src/lib/restaurant-permissions.ts` — editing Media sits behind the same
permission as business profile, **not** a dedicated Cloudinary/media permission:
- `rm.settings.manage` — "Configure restaurant settings and integrations"
- `rm.profile.manage` — "Edit restaurant profile, hours and contact details"

Either grants edit access to the whole Settings page (business info + Cloudinary fields + payment
methods). Note Products/Categories image *uploads* are gated separately, by `rm.menu.manage` — not
by the settings/profile permission. If Super Admin wants a dedicated media permission instead of
overloading `restaurants.manage`, that's a deliberate deviation to call out, not something to assume.

| Action | Orderly Hub permission | Super Admin permission (existing pattern) |
|---|---|---|
| Edit a restaurant's Cloudinary cloud name / preset | `rm.settings.manage` or `rm.profile.manage` | `restaurants.manage` |
| Upload a menu item / category image | `rm.menu.manage` | `restaurants.manage` (menus.tsx currently has no finer-grained gate — verify before assuming parity) |

---

## 9. Landmines

- **`businessSettingsPath.ts` is dead code** in Orderly Hub — don't copy its `businessId` /
  `settings/business(es)` scheme (§0.1).
- **RTDB, not Firestore** — don't build against a Firestore SDK because a sibling doc said Firestore
  (§0.2).
- **Decided: no folder namespacing** — each restaurant gets its own account/tab (§1.2). Don't
  reintroduce a shared-account-with-folders design without a fresh, explicit product decision; this
  doc already weighed that alternative and rejected it for this handover.
- **Four existing call sites in this repo will silently keep using the platform-wide account**
  unless you explicitly wire in restaurant-level overrides — adding the field to the type alone is a
  no-op (§5).
- **No dedicated media library / asset browser page exists in Orderly Hub** to mirror — this doc is
  about the config tab + wiring existing upload call sites only. Don't build a media library as part
  of this handover unless separately asked; it would be new scope, not parity.
- **Never add an API key or secret field.** Unlike the Stripe secret key situation in the Payments
  doc, there is no secret to carry over here at all — if a future ask wants *signed* uploads, that
  needs a server-side signing endpoint (Cloud Function) and is explicitly out of scope for this doc,
  same as the Payments doc keeps server-side Checkout Session creation out of scope.
- **A restaurant's Media tab must never be editable without that restaurant's own id in scope** —
  don't build a "default Cloudinary account" picker that could accidentally apply one restaurant's
  credentials to another (§7).

---

## 10. Acceptance checklist

- [ ] `FirebaseRestaurant` gains `cloudinaryCloudName?: string` and `cloudinaryUploadPreset?: string`
      (§2), camelCase, optional/blank-safe.
- [ ] New "Media" tab on the restaurant detail page reads and writes these two fields on
      `restaurants/{id}` directly (§7) — not a nested object, not a separate document — for the
      specific restaurant whose detail page it's on, and no other restaurant.
- [ ] The four existing `CloudinaryImageUpload` call sites (§5) — plus any new ones this tab
      introduces — are updated to pass restaurant-level overrides ahead of the platform-wide config
      (§6), verified by: set a restaurant's own cloud name/preset, upload an image there, confirm
      the resulting `secure_url` is hosted under that cloud name, not the platform one.
- [ ] Restaurants that have **not** set their own Cloudinary credentials continue to upload via the
      platform-wide config exactly as they do today — no regression for existing restaurants.
- [ ] The per-restaurant vs platform-wide vs env fallback priority (§6) is implemented as one
      resolution, not duplicated logic.
- [ ] Permission gating decision (§8) made deliberately and documented, not assumed from parity.
- [ ] Confirmed each restaurant's Media tab is reachable only from that restaurant's own detail page
      and cannot be edited or displayed without a specific restaurant in scope (§7, §9).

## 11. AI implementation prompt (copy-paste)

```
You are updating the Super Admin console (forkfleet-admin-console, this repo) to add a per-restaurant
Media (Cloudinary) configuration tab, matching how Restaurant Admin ("Orderly Hub") lets each
restaurant configure its own Cloudinary cloud name + unsigned upload preset (reference:
docs/RESTAURANT_ADMIN_TO_SUPER_ADMIN_MEDIA_HANDOVER.md, this file, in this repo). Copy the schema
exactly; the UI and resolution-priority integration are yours to adapt to this repo's existing
platform-wide Cloudinary settings.

## Goal
Give each restaurant its own optional Cloudinary account (cloud name + unsigned upload preset),
linked to that one restaurant, so its own product photos, category images, cover image and logo can
be isolated from other restaurants' assets and from the platform-wide default — while restaurants
that don't configure their own keep working exactly as they do today via the platform-wide config.

## Required behaviour

### 1. Schema
- Add `cloudinaryCloudName?: string` and `cloudinaryUploadPreset?: string` to `FirebaseRestaurant`
  (src/lib/restaurants.firebase.ts) — exact field names, camelCase, matching Orderly Hub's
  production data.
- These live directly on `restaurants/{id}`, siblings of `payment_config` — not nested, not a
  separate document.

### 2. New "Media" tab — one per restaurant
- Add a "Media" tab to the restaurant detail page (src/routes/_authenticated/restaurants/$id.tsx),
  alongside the existing tabs, gated on the same `restaurants.manage` permission as the rest of the
  page.
- The tab must read/write `restaurants/{id}.cloudinaryCloudName` / `.cloudinaryUploadPreset` for
  THAT restaurant's route id only — never a shared or cross-restaurant path.
- Fields: Cloud name, Upload preset (unsigned) — same captions/placeholders as
  src/routes/_authenticated/settings.tsx's existing platform-wide "Media (Cloudinary)" section
  (reuse that copy, don't reinvent it).
- Show which config tier is currently active for this restaurant (its own vs the platform default).

### 3. Resolution priority
Extend (don't duplicate) src/lib/cloudinary.ts's resolveCloudinaryOptions() priority chain:
restaurant's own fields → platform-wide settings.media fields → VITE_CLOUDINARY_* env → "ml_default".
Compose this at each call site by building the `overrides` object with the restaurant's fields
first, falling back to the platform `useCloudinaryConfig()` overrides.

### 4. Wire existing call sites
Update ALL current CloudinaryImageUpload usages under a restaurant context — currently:
src/routes/_authenticated/restaurants/index.tsx:881, src/routes/_authenticated/restaurants/$id.tsx:614,
src/routes/_authenticated/menus.tsx:602 and :1143 — to pass the resolved per-restaurant overrides
instead of relying solely on the platform-wide config.

### 5. Do not
- Add any API key/secret field — Cloudinary uploads here are unsigned only, by design, on both sides.
- Build shared-account-with-folders namespacing — that alternative was considered and rejected for
  this handover; each restaurant gets its own account/tab, full stop.
- Build a media library / asset browser page — out of scope, Orderly Hub has none to mirror.
- Regress any restaurant that hasn't configured its own Cloudinary account — it must keep using the
  platform-wide default exactly as today.
- Make the Media tab reachable or editable without a specific restaurant already in scope.
